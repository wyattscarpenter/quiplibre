Quiplibre
=========

This is Quiplibre, a Free Software alternative to Quiplash.

## How do I work this?

Quiplibre is available by viewing quiplibre.html in a web browser. You can either download the html file and view it locally, or visit https://wyattscarpenter.github.io/quiplibre/ on your phone or computer or whatever.

Once you are looking at quiplibre, you will be given a chance to host a new game or join a game as a player.

NOTE: You must be connected to the internet to play quiplibre.

## I'm playing during a pandemic and all my friends are in different houses, can we still play?

Sure! Just open a hosting session, and then have each player including yourself open a joining session. Quiplibre is still mostly functional even without a "big screen" everyone can see.

## Can I write my own custom prompts?

Sure, just modify the prompts array in the html file. It's a big ol' list of prompts, named `prompts`. You must surround your prompt in quotation marks (either 'single' or "double") and after the closing quotation mark put a comma. Give it a shot!

You might want to make a copy of the unaltered prompts first and put it somewhere convenient, so you can go back to the default prompts easily.

## So I notice this project is missing a lot of the bells and whistles of Quiplash, such as music, timers, colors, etc

Yeah, I couldn't be bothered. If you'd like to try to spruce Quiplibre up, go right ahead :)

## What do I do if I think of a good prompt (or other contribution) I'd like to submit?

Raise an issue or submit a pull request on https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/quiplibre. Only submit prompts you have the legal right and volition to release under the project's license, though. Don't be stealing copyrighted works to submit as Quiplash prompts!

## On The Category Of Games That Are Like Quiplash

Games that are like [Quiplash](https://www.jackboxgames.com/quiplash/) could perhaps be called "quip games" or "quiplikes". At time of writing (2023-09-07) here are the quiplikes I know about:

* alternativeto.net lists 16 alternatives to quiplash, many of them quiplikes, including this one https://alternativeto.net/software/quiplash/
* [Quibbl.in](http://web.archive.org/web/20230628130022/https://quibbl.in/), although I get the impression that it is now defunct
* [QwiqWit.com](https://www.qwiqwit.com), also described here: http://paulwind.com/work/qwiqwit
* there are several versions of Quiplash published by Jackbox Games, which I guess are technically quiplikes
* the various forks of Quiplibre are cool! I haven't looked over them in depth, but some of them probably have better UX than Quiplibre itself https://github.com/wyattscarpenter/quiplibre/forks?include=active&page=1&period=&sort_by=stargazer_counts
* there are various quiplash-related repos on github, some of them apparently open source quiplikes, which is nice :) https://github.com/search?q=quiplash&type=repositories
* there may have been, in human history, various times at which someone invented "write funny answers to amusing prompts" as a game, but I haven't looked into it.
